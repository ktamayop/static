### Hi there!
I'm a Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience. I was born in Cuba and currently living in (and loving) Montevideo, Uruguay since March, 2017. I've been married to one of the best and most beautiful human beings on earth for seven years now - Yenny - and we have that gorgeus 4-month-old little girl in the picture above - Ema - that's the world to us. 

### About Me
I had contact with my first PC back in 1995 and I was hooked up forever with computers. I started learning BASIC and later Turbo Pascal in 1998 for a High School Programming Contest at my hometown. I got my Bachelor's Degree at University of Computer Sciences (UCI), Havana, Cuba in 2007.

## What I value
* Family
* Quality over quantity (specially when talking about friends)
* Hard work
* Teamwork over rock stars and lonely wolves
* Brutal honesty
* Persistence

## Interests
* Learning to learn
* Personal finances education
* Coffee
* Soccer
* Cooking
* Dance
* Podcasts

## Completely useless fun facts
* I did web development in a country with no "web development" at all. (Get it?) It's incredible how much one can learn by doing that.
* I love to play soccer (apparently I'm good at it, not that good to get a contract from the Premier League or Spanish La Liga, but I'm OK according to my friends). 
* I'm an amateur [competitive programmer](https://www.hackerearth.com/@karel4). Not a very good one, though!
* I can listen Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Metallica and a Salsa song in the same playlist with no issues.
* I can dance [Cuban Salsa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVFKXMSMqA) (_Casino_ we call it), even on a ["rueda"](https://youtu.be/b4jaXaC1P04).
